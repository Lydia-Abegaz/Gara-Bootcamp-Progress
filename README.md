**Task: The FizzBuzz Challenge**

This classic programming exercise requires you to write a TypeScript program using a `for` loop to count from 1 to 100. 
For each number, print one of the following to the console:
-"FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
-"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
-"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
-"The number itself if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
